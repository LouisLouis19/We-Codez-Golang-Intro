                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This week, we will delve into `while` loops and offer extensive practice problems to reinforce your understanding of loops and conditional statements.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="while-loops">
                <h2>While Loops</h2>
                <p>A `while` loop in Python continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. Unlike `for` loops, `while` loops are ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations isn't predetermined.</p>
                <p>Basic structure:</p>
                <pre class="code-block">while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is True</pre>

                <p>Example:</p>
                <pre class="code-block">counter = 0

while counter < 5:
    print("Counter is at:", counter)
    counter += 1</pre>

                <p>In this example, the loop continues to print the value of `counter` until it reaches 5, at which point the condition `counter < 5` becomes false, and the loop stops.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="infinite-loops">
                <h2>Be Careful with Infinite Loops</h2>
                <p>While loops are powerful, but you must ensure that the loop's condition eventually becomes false. If it never does, the loop will continue indefinitely, causing an "infinite loop". This can crash your program or cause it to become unresponsive.</p>
                <p>Example of an infinite loop:</p>
                <pre class="code-block">while True:
    print("This loop will run forever!")</pre>

                <p>To prevent infinite loops, always ensure that the loop's condition will eventually become false, either by changing a variable within the loop or by using a break statement.</p>
