          <p>
            This week, we will delve into `while` loops and offer extensive
            practice problems to reinforce your understanding of loops and
            conditional statements.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="while-loops">
          <h2>While Loops</h2>
          <p>
            A `while` loop in Python continues to execute a block of code as
            long as a specified condition remains true. Unlike `for` loops,
            `while` loops are ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations
            isn't predetermined.
          </p>
          <p>Basic structure:</p>
          <pre class="code-block">
while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is True</pre
          >

          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre class="code-block">
counter = 0

while counter < 5:
    print("Counter is at:", counter)
    counter += 1</pre
          >

          <p>
            In this example, the loop continues to print the value of `counter`
            until it reaches 5, at which point the condition `counter < 5`
            becomes false, and the loop stops.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="infinite-loops">
          <h2>Be Careful with Infinite Loops</h2>
          <p>
            While loops are powerful tools that allow you to repeat a block of
            code as long as a condition is true. However, if that condition
            never becomes false, the loop will continue indefinitely. This is
            known as an "infinite loop." Infinite loops can cause your program
            to freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
          </p>

          <p>Example of an infinite loop:</p>
          <pre class="code-block">
while True:
print("This loop will run forever!")</pre
          >

          <p>
            In this case, because the condition <code>True</code> never changes
            to <code>False</code>, the loop runs forever. If you're not careful,
            infinite loops like this can lead to memory exhaustion or make your
            program hang.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Avoid Infinite Loops</h3>
          <p>
            To prevent infinite loops, you need to ensure that the loop's
            condition will eventually become false. This can be achieved in a
            few ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Modify a variable that affects the loop's condition inside the
              loop.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use logical conditions that will eventually stop being true.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a <code>break</code> statement to forcibly exit the loop when
              a certain condition is met.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Example of a correct loop with a variable that affects the loop's
            condition:
          </p>
          <pre class="code-block">
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print("Counter is", counter)
    counter += 1  # The condition will eventually become False</pre
          >

          <h3>The <code>break</code> Statement</h3>
          <p>
            The <code>break</code> statement allows you to exit a loop
            prematurely, even if the loop’s condition is still true. This is
            particularly useful for situations where you are waiting for a
            specific condition to be met, or to prevent an infinite loop from
            continuing under certain circumstances.
          </p>

          <p>
            Example of using the <code>break</code> statement to prevent an
            infinite loop:
          </p>
          <pre class="code-block">
while True:
user_input = input("Type 'exit' to stop the loop: ")
if user_input == 'exit':
    print("Exiting the loop.")
    break  # Exit the loop if the user types 'exit'
else:
    print("The loop continues...")</pre
          >

          <p>
            In this case, the loop will only continue as long as the user
            doesn’t type "exit". When the user types "exit", the
            <code>break</code> statement stops the loop, even though the
            condition <code>True</code> would normally keep it going forever.
          </p>

          <h3>Tips for Preventing Infinite Loops</h3>
          <p>
            Here are a few best practices to avoid infinite loops in your
            programs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make sure the loop's condition is properly defined and will
              eventually be met.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regularly check the loop's condition to ensure it can be changed
              by something inside the loop.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re not sure about a loop’s behavior, use print statements
              to debug and see the loop’s progress.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider using the <code>break</code> statement if you need to
              exit the loop under specific conditions.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Remember, careful planning of your loop's logic will help you avoid
            infinite loops and keep your programs running smoothly.
